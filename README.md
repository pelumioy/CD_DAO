# CD_DAO
A simple DAO prpject that allows holders of the cd token create proposals and also vote on existing ones. 
When a proposal is created, it will have a timeframe in which members of the DAO are supposed to either vote in favour of or against that proposal.
After the time runs out, which ever position (yes or no) has the highest vote will be actioned.
